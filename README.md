# 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge 🚀
Welcome to my **100 Days of Leetcode Challenge**. This repository documents my journey as I solve one LeetCode
problem each day for the next 100 days. My aim is to improve my problem-solving skills, learn algorithms,
and enhance my understanding of data structures.

## 🎯 Challenge Goals
- Solve at least 1 problem daily for 100 days.
- Tackle problems of varying difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- Document each solution with explanations and learning notes.

Each day's folder will include:
1. The Python file with the solution 
2. A README.md file summarizing the problem, approach, and code.
